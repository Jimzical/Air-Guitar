okay so


- strum action
    - two ways to strum
        - one is to have pixel percentage of the guitar change significantly 
            - the other optimization to get distance from the center of the guitar and have the pixel percentage change based on that
        - the other is to use mediapipe or something to get the distance between thumb and index finger and have the pixel percentage change based on that

- fret action
    - few ways to fret
        - identify fingers very accurately and make 16 sounds 
            - not sure how but is a good idea
        - identify the index finger only and get distance between both hands
            - good way but need to identify dunno how
            = also
                - have a wave to get multiple fingers so different sounds based on how many fingers are down
                    - good but not sure how to get the wave 
        
        - identiy the frets and have the pixel percentage change based on that (bad because it's hard to identify the frets)
        - identify the fingers and have the pixel percentage change based on that
            - tough to get acurate finger detection and only 4 sounds so it's not worth it
        
- sound action
    - use multiple sound clips with multiple combinations of sounds
        - q: how many chords on guitar
        - a: 4
        - q: waht are they
        - a: e, a, d, g

        - create a code to have smooth transformations
            - complex 
    - use the fibbonaci bullshit to create custom waveforms dynamically 
        - light weight
        -
