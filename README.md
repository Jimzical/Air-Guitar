Play a Guitar without having a Guitar

It detects your hands and draws six strings which when comes into contact with the index finger plays that particular string sound

- ill make a proper description when im done with the next update


currently plays the songs but string detection does not work well with very fast hand movements
have to implement chords, have created a way to do that just have to get around to adding it to the main projefct
